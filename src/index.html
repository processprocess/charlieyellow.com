          york newyork japan japanese flamingo I love KeroKeroBonito. Her music
          feels like me, when I listen to it I get creative. So it made sense
          for me to make a music video for her song flamingo. It's the best way
          I can thank her! As well as Sokabe, lead Vocalist for the Japanese
          rock band Sunny Day Service (サニーデイ・サービス) I'm always drawing
          and animating for fun, and I collaborate with creative people! I like
          to tell stories through info graphics and love learning new concepts.
          Drop me a line and lets tell stories! I love people of all types,
          shapes and sizes. That's probably the reason I enjoy traveling so
          much. I guess I say 'everyone!' a lot, because my friend was joking
          with me about it and suggested we make a drawing about it :) Phil from
          bell.studio showed me a risograph and I was really inspired by the
          colors. We worked together to separate the artwork into colors and
          gradients that would pop on the Risograph RP3700. Edition of 10. Email
          me if you would like one. I might have a couple left! We might even do
          t-shirts with a friend of ours. Stay tuned!
